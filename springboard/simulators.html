        <li><b class="specific">Blocks: </b><a target="_blank" href="https://ftcsim.org/ftcsim">FTCSim (https://ftcsim.org/ftcsim)</a> - a 3D simulator with tutorials and a few different scenarios. You can only really make Autonomous programs in it as it does not seem to support gamepads, but that will let you make a driving robot. (well, the left stick controls the camera apparently but it doesn't actually control your robot) It runs online with Unity and doesn't have any performance issues on a modern computer (runs great on an AMD A-series APU, for reference). It is still in development, and the OnBotJava tab in particular is still in beta and lacks quite a few things from the SDK (notably ElapsedTime). It has tutorials and looks promising though, so perhaps if we use it enough, the developers will stay motivated and see this project through to completion.
        <ul>
          <li>Remember to use a <code class="inline"><span class="keyword">while</span> (opModeIsActive())</code> loop if you need something to keep running rather than a <code class="inline"><span class="keyword">while true</span></code> loop. The latter is considered poor practice for FTC (the SDK would prefer that your code stops when asked, not when killed) and will also cause FTCSim to hang immediately. (It makes sense becuase it's stuck in an infinite loop.)</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b class="specific">Blocks: </b><a target="_blank" href="https://vrobotsim.com">Virtual Robot Sim (VRS for short) (https://vrobotsim.com)</a>! <a target="_blank" href="https://vrobotsim.org">Also Virtual Robot Sim! (https://vrobotsim.<em>org</em>)</a> You want the <em>.com</em> site, where you can download the program. This is just like FTCSim, except that it has gamepad support so you can make TeleOp (driver-controlled) programs (and Java is somehow even more broken than FTCSim - it gives random errors for just about anything). They offer both a Windows installer and a web application.</li>
        <li><b class="specific">Java: </b><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Beta8397/virtual_robot">Beta8397/virtual_robot on GitHub</a> - This is written in Java and can be run from Android Studio. It provides its own TeamCode package, where you could either use the samples or paste your own programs into it. When you click Run, it builds the simulator program with your OpModes in it, just like how the Robot Controller gets built normally. It supports USB gamepads like a Driver Station, or you can use the default virtual gamepad. When you run an OpMode, Studio's Run pane (at the bottom) will show you any errors and links to where they occurred.</li>
