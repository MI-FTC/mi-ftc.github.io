    <h3>FTC Simulators</h3>
    <p>Basically, you want <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Beta8397/virtual_robot">Beta8397/virtual_robot on GitHub</a> if you're doing Java. If you're doing Blocks and you can live with only having Autonomous programs, try <a target="_blank" href="https://ftcsim.org/ftcsim">FTCSim</a> <span class="small">(if your system can handle Unity on the web)</span>. You can also try <a target="_blank" href="http://vrobotsim.com">Virtual Robot Sim</a>, which might let you make TeleOp programs too.</p>

		<p>Perhaps you want to test some code when you don't have direct access to a robot. It's nice to be able to test your programs at home so you can spend valuable shop time on more important things than wrangling null pointers and configuration errors. One possibility is to at least make sure they initialize by using two phones, one as a robot controller and another as a driver station, even if you can't control anything with them. This will at least let you test the actually interesting parts of the code in the shop and keep all those embarrassing initialization errors to yourself.</p>
    <p>There are also multiple options around for simulating an FTC robot. Here are all the ones that I have found and tried so far:
      <ul>
        <li><b class="specific">Blocks: </b><a target="_blank" href="https://ftcsim.org/ftcsim">FTCSim (https://ftcsim.org/ftcsim)</a> - a 3D simulator with tutorials and a few different scenarios. You can only really make Autonomous programs in it as it does not support gamepads, but that will let you make a driving robot. (well, the left stick controls the camera apparently but it doesn't actually control your robot) It runs online with Unity and doesn't have any performance issues on a nice computer ("nice" being an AMD A-Series APU, for reference). It is still in development, and the OnBotJava tab in particular is still in beta and lacks quite a few things from the SDK (notably ElapsedTime). It has tutorials and looks promising though, so perhaps if we use it enough, the developers will stay motivated and see this project through to completion.
        <ul>
          <li>Remember to use a <code class="inline"><span class="keyword">while</span> (opModeIsActive())</code> loop if you need something to keep running rather than a <code class="inline"><span class="keyword">while true</span></code> loop. The latter is probably not the best idea and will also cause FTCSim to hang immediately. It makes sense becuase you got it stuck in your infinite loop.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b class="specific">Blocks: </b><a target="_blank" href="https://vrobotsim.com">Virtual Robot Sim (VRS for short) (https://vrobotsim.com)</a>! <a target="_blank" href="https://vrobotsim.org">Also Virtual Robot Sim! (https://vrobotsim.<em>org</em>)</a> <i class="small">The <em>.org</em> domain seems to give an SSL error, in Firefox at least. Unless you opened it with a link from the program itself, then it doesn't care and shows you the website. Hmm.</i> Anyway, you want the <em>.com</em> site, where they actually have downloads. This is just like FTCSim, except that it has gamepad support so you can make TeleOp (driver-controlled) programs (and Java is somehow even more broken than FTCSim - it gives random errors for just about anything). They offer both a Windows installer and a web application.</li>
        <li><b class="specific">Java: </b>What if someone who actually knows how to do a simple thing simply made an FTC robot simulator? Now we know the answer thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Beta8397/virtual_robot">Beta8397/virtual_robot on GitHub</a>. This is written in Java and can be run from Android Studio. It provides its own TeamCode package, where you could either use the samples or paste your own programs into it. When you click Run, it builds the simulator program with your OpModes in it, just like how the Robot Controller gets built normally. It doesn't seem to have USB gamepad support, but it has a virtual gamepad which will work alright for testing. When you run an OpMode, Studio's Run pane (at the bottom) will show you any errors and links to where they occurred.
        <br>
        As a nice bonus, it actually works as advertised! That same OpMode that Virtual Robot Sim couldn't run works beautifully here. Sure, VRS just prioritized Blocks, but they said nothing about it (and they've been at this for years) so it's harder to have sympathy for them. Let's use this opportunity as a small reminder of where your priorities should lie as a programmer. It could theoretically be nice to be able to view the elevator in 3D or even import a custom 3D model like VRS lets you, but it doesn't matter how fancy and refined your program appears if it doesn't work as advertised. virtual_robot doesn't have the same looks or release-ready feel, but it actually works. The developer implemented the functionality of the program, the <em>actually important stuff</em> first before getting distracted by frivolities, making this program far more valuable than VRS.</li>
      </ul>
