      <h5 class="theader">Choose a Programming Environment</h5> - <i class="tdesc">It's worth setting it up now so you can just think about code later.</i><ul>
        <li>If you are a brand new programmer, consult with your mentors (or, better yet, a family member who is a programmer) to determine whether Blocks or Java is best for you. Blocks is often considered to be easier for new programmers to understand, and we would recommend starting with that if you cannot consult with anyone. Otherwise, ask someone who knows you better than this paragraph of text does in case there is a better path for you.</li>
        <li>If you are more used to a Blockly language <i class="mdesc">(code.org, Scratch, AppInventor)</i>, want a more visual representation of your code, or are part of a team that exclusively uses Blocks code, then <b style="color: green">Blocks</b> could be a good option for you. However, Java has important advantages <i class="mdesc">(libraries, full access to the SDK, more support materials)</i> that you cannot get with Blocks, so remember it as an option if you ever need that functionality in the future. It shouldn't be too hard to switch over. If you wish to proceed with Blocks, you will be using the REV Hardware Client, so skip the Android Studio section of this page.<ul>
          <li class="mdesc">Perhaps you noticed that we didn't list <a target="_blank" href="https://snap.berkeley.edu"><i>Snap!</i></a> as an example of a Blockly language. It is, in fact, the finest example of a Blockly language overall, and its "more advanced" nature is such that programmers who are confident in <i>Snap!</i> will likely have a better time in Java than they would dealing with the abstractions and lack of language features present in Blocks.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>If you have fallen through all of the conditions above <b>[OR]</b> have done some programming in a text-based language and been at least reasonably confident in what you were doing, then you should consider programming in Java. This appears to be the most popular option with the widest library of support, and it allows you full access to the SDK <i class="mdesc">(Despite what REV might say, not everything is available in Blocks)</i> and Java language features. There are two environments available in which to program in Java - <b style="color: green">OnBotJava</b> and <b style="color: green">Android Studio</b> - and the best option is probably just the one your team uses. However, there are two notable advantages to Android Studio:<ul>
          <li>The code is edited from a location other than the robot itself, then the TeamCode package is built onto the robot. It is possible to create and edit code without a Control Hub on hand, which is <i>awesome</i> if you enjoy writing code at home rather than at school.</li>
          <li>Studio can integrate with a Version Control System (VCS), such as Git <i class="mdesc">(covered below)</i>. Many teams who use Studio host their code on a GitHub repository to enable all their programmers to write code from home, and the VCS lets multiple people modify the same file and have their changes safely merged together. Once everyone is back at the shop, the code can be built onto the actual robot.</li>
        </ul></li>

Still, for FTC it must follow a basic structure. This involves making your class extend either OpMode or LinearOpMode, and deciding which to use can be a bit tricky. Here's the simple answer:<ul>
            <li>If you are brand new to this, <b style="color: green">LinearOpMode</b> is probably your best bet for writing your first programs.</li>
            <li>If you have only worked with procedural programming (Lightbot, basic programs with no <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)">callbacks</a> (functions as objects), etc.), then you will want to start with <b style="color: green">LinearOpMode</b>.</li>
            <li>If you are at least reasonably confident in handling <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)">callbacks</a> (functions as objects) <b>OR</b> have ever programmed for Arduino, you will almost certainly prefer <b style="color: green">OpMode</b>.</li>

      <h5 class="theader">More Resources</h5>
      <p>You will never memorize everything. You have already become a confident programmer when you can gather the information you need to complete a task on your own. Plenty of good resources are available on the internet, and here's a few reliable sources to help you start exploring. Additionally, a great project for your first off-season is to just go make something - perhaps a well-made OpMode or an interface you wish you had during the season - that requires knowledge and expertise you don't have yet. <i class="mdesc">(Quick tip: A good first skill to gain is a basic understanding of object-oriented programming. <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/">Here's an introduction.</a>)</i> Once you start looking up how to do a few things, you will become comfortable with using the search engine as a resource very quickly.</p>
