      <h5 class="theader">Choose a Programming Environment</h5> - <i class="tdesc">It's worth setting it up now so you can just think about code later.</i><ul>
        <li>If you are a brand new programmer, look for someone to consult with regarding whether you should start with Blocks or Java. The best person to talk to would be a friend or family member who is a programmer, because they know you well. If you don't know any programmers, ask your team's mentors. They will know the benefits and drawbacks of both methods and can help you learn in a way that will make it easier for you to work with the rest of the team. If nobody around you actually knows much about this, see this list:
          <div class="section"><ul>
            <li><b style="color: green">Blocks</b> lets you assemble a program with visual blocks that you can drag around. The program will execute top-to-bottom down a chain of blocks. Some blocks produce values, and they will fit into spaces on other blocks which accept values. (Programming is really all about moving data around.) A text-based language, such as <span class="specific">Java</span>, instead relies on typed lines of code, which also (usually) execute top-to-bottom. The main advantage to Blocks is that each block is visible in the menu you grab them from, so you can immediately see all the available options. With a text-based language, you have to determine the task you want to accomplish then look up what tools the language provides to do that. All the options can indeed be found, and Java makes it relatively easy with Javadoc, but you have to look slightly deeper to find them. However, most programmers find that this advantage of Blocks is quickly outweighed by the many benefits of text-based languages:<ul>
                <li>A lot more features are available, and you can create more that you can share across all of your programs. <i class="small">(This is a simplified description of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)">Libraries</a>.)</i></li>
                <li>It is easier to split your code into sections, as you can divide it across multiple files. (This makes it easier to manage larger projects, as you can develop or even replace individual sections easily.)</li>
                <li>It can be much faster to type each line than it is to find and drag the correct block to the correct location.</li>
                <li>For FTC in particular, a lot more support materials are available for Java, and it is a lot easier to utilize libraries and collaborate as a team, especially when your team uses Android Studio to decentralize the workflow.</li>
              </ul>
            If you have ever done some programming in a text-based language and been at least reasonably confident in what you were doing, then you should consider programming in Java.</li>
        </ul></ul></div>
        <p>Blocks can be a good tool to help you learn to program, but at this age, you are likely patient enough to be able to learn the basics of a text-based language and look up what you can use to accomplish a given task. We recommend <span class="specific">Java</span> whenever it is feasible, but if you are having a hard time understanding the foundational concepts, you might want to fall back to Blocks for a little while. You might not even want to use FTC blocks - <a target="_blank" href="http://appinventor.mit.edu">MIT AppInventor</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://snap.berkeley.edu">Berkeley's <i>Snap!</i></a> are great options for teaching the foundational concepts of programming in ways that can be carried into text-based languages.</p>
        </li>
        <!-- <li>If you are more used to a Blockly language <i class="mdesc">(code.org, Scratch, AppInventor)</i>, want a more visual representation of your code, or are part of a team that exclusively uses Blocks code, then <b style="color: green">Blocks</b> could be a good option for you. However, Java has important advantages <i class="small">(libraries, full access to the SDK, more available support materials)</i> that you cannot get with Blocks, so remember it as an option if you ever need that functionality in the future. It shouldn't be too hard to switch over. If you wish to proceed with Blocks, you will be working directly with the Control Hub, so skip the Android Studio section of this page.<ul>
          <li class="small">Perhaps you noticed that we didn't list <a target="_blank" href="https://snap.berkeley.edu"><i>Snap!</i></a> as an example of a Blockly language. It is, in fact, the finest example of a Blockly language overall, and its more featureful nature is such that programmers who are confident in <i>Snap!</i> will likely have a better time in Java than they would dealing with the abstractions and lack of language features present in Blocks.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>If you have fallen through all of the conditions above <b>[OR]</b> have done some programming in a text-based language and been at least reasonably confident in what you were doing, then you should consider programming in Java. This appears to be the most popular option with the widest library of support, and it allows you full access to the SDK <i class="mdesc">(Despite what REV might say, not everything is available in Blocks)</i> and Java language features. There are two environments available in which to program in Java - <b style="color: green">OnBotJava</b> and <b style="color: green">Android Studio</b> - and the best option is probably just the one your team uses. However, there are two notable advantages to Android Studio:<ul> -->
        <p>If you decided on Blocks, you will be interacting directly with the Robot Controller. You can safely ignore the <b>Android Studio</b> section of this page. If you chose Java, there are two environments available. There is no difficulty gradient between the two, and for consistency, you should choose the one that the rest of your team already uses.<ul>
        <li><span class="specific">OnBotJava</span> is a Java editor built into the Robot Controller. OpModes must be edited on and saved to that device. If you will be using this option, you can safely ignore the <b>Android Studio</b> section of this page.</li>
        <li><span class="specific">Android Studio</span> is an IDE (<b>I</b>ntegrated <b>D</b>evelopment <b>E</b>nvironment), which provides additional features such as code completion (it can suggest available fields and methods as you are typing) and the ability to edit code without a Robot Controller present and build it onto one <em>or more</em> Robot Controllers later. Studio can also integrate with a Version Control System (VCS), such as Git <i class="small">(covered below)</i>. Many teams who use Studio host their code on a GitHub repository to enable all their programmers to write code from home, and the VCS lets multiple people modify the same file and have their changes safely merged together. Once everyone is back at the shop, the code can be built onto the actual robot. If you are using Studio, the entire page applies to you. You will still need to interact with a Robot Controller on occasion, so read the section below.</li>

      <li>Most forum and Q&amp;A sites are trustworthy. If you don't feel comfortable with it, you can look for another one, but the helpfulness of a particular thread usually only has to do with its relevancy, or at least the relevancy of any of its answers, to your problem. It's the users of a site that determine its trustworthiness, not the site itself. Well-known forums for programming help include Stack Exchange/Stack Overflow and Reddit.</li>
