      <p>This is roughly representative of what will be published at the start of the 2023-24 season (Sept. 9). Do note that this page may be improved at any time, even during the season as novel issues and concepts arise. Even if this page does not fully suit the way your team works, hopefully it can still be a helpful resource to get your new programmers started on the right foot. We are looking into adding alternate themes for the site. If it is feasible, there may be a couple other style options "soon". <i class="small">(This note describes the current stage of development on this page, and will disappear once the game has been revealed.)</i></p>

      <p>At the moment, this page is best viewed on a device with a larger screen. We are hoping to implement some alternative styles soon. We found it to be more important in this first iteration to include all the important information than it was to make tiny paragraphs for mobile screens.</p>

      <h5 class="theader">Choose a Programming Environment</h5> - <i class="tdesc">It's worth setting it up now so you can just think about code later.</i>
      <p>If you are a brand new programmer, look for someone to consult with regarding whether you should start with Blocks or Java. The best person to talk to would be a friend or family member who is a programmer, because they know you well. If you don't know any programmers, ask your team's mentors. They will know the benefits and drawbacks of both methods and can help you learn in a way that will make it easier for you to work with the rest of the team. If nobody around you actually knows much about this, see this list:</p>
      <div class="section">
        <ul style="margin: 8px;">
          <li>
            <span class="specific">Blocks</span> lets you assemble a program with visual blocks that you can drag around. The program will execute top-to-bottom down a chain of blocks. Some blocks produce values, and they will fit into spaces on other blocks which accept values. (Programming is really all about moving data around.) A text-based language, such as <span class="specific">Java</span>, instead relies on typed lines of code, which also (usually) execute top-to-bottom. The main advantage to Blocks is that each block is visible in the menu you grab them from, so you can immediately see all the available options. With a text-based language, you have to determine the task you want to accomplish then look up what tools the language provides to do that. All the options can indeed be found, and Java makes it relatively easy with Javadoc, but you have to look slightly deeper to find them. However, most programmers find that this advantage of Blocks is quickly outweighed by the many benefits of text-based languages:
            <ul>
              <li>A lot more features are available, and you can create more that you can share across all of your programs. <i class="small">(This is a simplified description of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)">Libraries</a>.)</i></li>
              <li>It is easier to split your code into sections, as you can divide it across multiple files. (This makes it easier to manage larger projects, as you can develop or even replace individual sections easily.)</li>
              <li>It can be much faster to type each line than it is to find and drag the correct block to the correct location.</li>
              <li>For FTC in particular, a lot more support materials are available for Java, and it is a lot easier to utilize libraries and collaborate as a team, especially when your team uses Android Studio to decentralize the workflow.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If you have ever done some programming in a text-based language and felt at least reasonably confident in what you were doing, then you should consider programming in Java. Blocks can be a good tool to help you learn to program, but at this age, you are likely patient enough to be able to learn the basics of a text-based language and look up what you can use to accomplish a given task. We recommend <span class="specific">Java</span> whenever it is feasible, but if you are having a hard time understanding the foundational concepts, you might want to fall back to Blocks for a little while. You might not even want to use FTC blocks - <a target="_blank" href="http://appinventor.mit.edu">MIT AppInventor</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://snap.berkeley.edu">Berkeley's <i>Snap!</i></a> are great options for teaching the foundational concepts of programming in ways that can be carried into text-based languages.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
        <p>If you decided on Blocks, you will be interacting directly with the Robot Controller. You can safely ignore the <span class="specific">Android Studio</span> section of this page. If you chose Java, there are two environments available. There is no difficulty gradient between the two, and for consistency, you should choose the one that the rest of your team already uses.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="specific">OnBotJava</span> is a Java editor built into the Robot Controller. OpModes must be edited on and saved to that device. If you will be using this option, you can safely ignore the <b>Android Studio</b> section of this page.</li>
          <li><span class="specific">Android Studio</span> is an IDE (<b>I</b>ntegrated <b>D</b>evelopment <b>E</b>nvironment), which provides additional features such as code completion (it can suggest available fields and methods as you are typing) and the ability to edit code without a Robot Controller present and build it onto one <em>or more</em> Robot Controllers later. Studio can also integrate with a Version Control System (VCS), such as Git <i class="small">(covered below)</i>. Many teams who use Studio host their code on a GitHub repository to enable all their programmers to write code from home, and the VCS lets multiple people modify the same file and have their changes safely merged together. Once everyone is back at the shop, the code can be built onto the actual robot. If you are using Studio, the entire page applies to you. You will still need to interact with a Robot Controller on occasion, so read the section below.</li>

            <p><b>An "OpMode" is a program, just like any other.</b> It's really no more complicated or confusing than that. Still, for FTC it must follow a basic structure. This involves making your class extend either OpMode or LinearOpMode, and deciding which to use can be a bit tricky. Here's the simple answer:
              <ul>
                <li>If you are brand new to this, <span class="specific">LinearOpMode</span> is probably your best bet for writing your first programs.</li>
                <li>If you have only worked with procedural programming (Lightbot, programs with no <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)">callbacks</a> (functions as objects), etc.), then you will want to start with <span class="specific">LinearOpMode</span>.</li>
                <li>If you are at least reasonably confident in handling <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)">callbacks</a> (functions as objects) <b>OR</b> have ever programmed for Arduino, you will almost certainly prefer <span class="specific">OpMode</span>.</li>

      <h5 class="theader">More Resources</h5>
      <p>You will never memorize everything. You have already become a confident programmer when you can gather the information you need to complete a task on your own. Plenty of good resources are available on the internet, and here's a few reliable sources to help you start exploring. Additionally, a great project for your first off-season is to just go make something - perhaps a well-made OpMode or an interface you wish you had during the season - that requires knowledge and expertise you don't have yet. <i class="mdesc">(Quick tip: A good first skill to gain is a basic understanding of object-oriented programming. <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/index.html">Here's an introduction.</a>)</i> Once you start looking up how to do a few things, you will become comfortable with using the search engine as a resource very quickly.</p>
      <p>When you can learn new things on your own, you don't need the Springboard anymore! Enjoy your time as a confident FTC programmer!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You will need the <a target="_blank" href="https://javadoc.io/doc/org.firstinspires.ftc">official API (Application Programming Interface) documentation</a>. - <i class="mdesc">This tells you all the classes and methods available, what arguments they take, what they will return, and their general purpose.
