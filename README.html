		<p>Here lies a small assortment of FTC programming resources, most 
			notably the <a target="_blank" href="index.html">Springboard</a> 
			(<a href="index.html">same tab</a>).</p>
		<p>This README is a (suboptimal) example of how we format and lay out 
			these pages.</p>
		<p>We link to other sources as much as possible, but sometimes the right
			material either does not exist or is not easy to understand. In 
			those situations, we create our own!</p>
		<p>If you want to improve something, please do! As far as I can tell,
			you should be able to check out the repo and make a pull request. I 
			haven't nailed down all the details of how this organization works 
			yet.</p>
		<p>If you find something wrong, please make a scene in the Issues 
			section.</p>
		<br>
		<p>A random recommendation for developers of this site: Try to use 
			relative links to site files when it makes sense. This will make it 
			easier to test the site in a local repo. I just had a situation 
			where Firefox grabbed an older version of the stylesheet on the 
			currently deployed website rather than the newer one from my local 
			repo.</p>
