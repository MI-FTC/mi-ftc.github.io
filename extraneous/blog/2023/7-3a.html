		<p>It's been another full day of work on the site, and there's quite a bit of new stuff today. I'm just going to list it off:<ul>
			<li>Wrote the first blog article (you're reading it right now!) - it's under the "extraneous" folder because it's not really that useful but it might serve to explain some things on occasion (particularly the purpose of the Springboard - that Navigation link will be live soon) and host a manageable changelog</li>
			<li>Added the Downloadable / Printable Materials section, featuring the Controls Template that I created a few days ago and the Boilerplate templates that I created today</li>
			<li>Brought over the existing Android Studio tutorials from the old staging site</li>
			<li>Wrote the two tutorials for OpMode and LinearOpMode - I wrote LinearOpMode first then copied it and modified it for OpMode. It actually only took an hour or so.</li>
			<li>Added some more features to global.css:<ul>
				<li>Standard font size options - class="small" now gives a font-size of 10pt and class="xsmall" gives a font-size of 8pt</li>
				<li>Inline code tags - setting the class of a code tag to "inline" will render it with <code class="inline">display: inline;</code> rather than <code class="inline">display: block;</code> (There's two examples of that!)</li>
				<li>Code colorization classes:<ul>
					<li>class="keyword" renders bold and blue</li>
					<li>class="annotation" renders goldenrod</li>
					<li>class="comment" renders gray</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>Improved comments</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul></p>
		<p>None of that actually involves the Springboard, despite that being the central focus of the site. I wanted to clear up everything that I had spun off before adding more stuff to it, and I did <i>everything</i> today, so perhaps tomorrow I can continue rounding out the Springboard.</p>
