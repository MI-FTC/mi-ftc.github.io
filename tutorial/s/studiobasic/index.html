      <p>When you first open Android Studio, you will be greeted with a welcome screen:</p>
      <img src="assets/studiowelcome.jpg">
      <p>If this installation has never been used before, it might have three large square buttons instead. This installation has had three projects created in it, which are displayed in a list. Above that list is a search box and three buttons - <span class="specific">New Project</span>, <span class="specific">Open</span>, and <span class="specific">Get from VCS</span>. For FTC, it is unlikely we will use <span class="specific">New Project</span> because we need to write our code inside the FtcRobotController project.</p>
      <p>FtcRobotController is found at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController">https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController</a>. There are three ways to get the project into Studio:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Avoid Git entirely:</b> Go to <span class="specific">Releases</span>, download and extract the source code archive, then open the resulting folder as a project in Studio.</li>
          <li><b>Get the project from GitHub:</b> Click the green <span class="specific">Code</span> dropdown towards the upper-right, and paste the URL into Studio's <span class="specific">Get from VCS</span> menu. Make sure to select Git as the version control system. Studio will clone it into a new local project. <i class="small">Note that you cannot push to the official repository, so this project will be accessible on that machine only unless you put it on a file server or something!</i></li>
          <li><b>Use your own GitHub repository:</b> A good way to make your own GitHub repository is to fork FtcRobotController. Try not to modify the Master branch if you can help it. This way, you can update your repository from the official one and continue to use it across seasons. Studio should have a <span class="specific">GitHub</span> option on the sidebar in the <span class="specific">Get from VCS</span> menu. Sign in with an account that has access to the repository, and you should be able to select it from the resulting list. Do be warned that Studio might want you to sign in with the account that actually owns the repository.</li>
        </ul>
      If you are using either of the GitHub options, note that Studio does not come with an installation of Git, so you may need to install it yourself. It can be found at <a target="_blank" href="http://git-scm.org">http://git-scm.org</a>.</p>

      <p>Your code appears in the large textbox to the right. The large menu to the left of it is the Projects pane. This is one of many panes you can select from the small strip to the far left. Double-clicking a file will open it as a new tab in the editing box. Tabs appear as a small strip immediately above this box. As with most text editors, <span class="specific">[Ctrl]+[S]</span> will save all open files.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>The IDE can provide some level of code-completion. When you start typing something, the IDE will search for terms in your code, the FtcRobotController SDK, or the Java standard library that might complete what you are typing, and it will pop up a list of these terms. You can use the up and down arrow keys to select the correct term, then either press <span class="specific">[Tab]</span> to insert it or <span class="specific">[Ctrl]+[.]</span> to insert it with a dot afterward.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>To create a new OpMode, right-click the folder / package (any folder in Java is a package) in which you want to create it or any item in that package, hover over the first option, <span class="specific">New</span>, then select the first option from the resulting menu, <span class="specific">Java Class</span>. <em>Make sure this OpMode is inside the <span class="specific">java</span> folder in the <span class="specific">TeamCode</span> package!</em> Studio will automatically create a class and add it to the package. Now you need to make it extend <a target="_blank" href="http://mi-ftc.github.io/tutorial/l/linearopmode/index.html">LinearOpMode</a> (<a href="http://mi-ftc.github.io/tutorial/l/linearopmode/index.html">same tab</a>) or <a target="_blank" href="http://mi-ftc.github.io/tutorial/o/opmode/index.html">OpMode</a> (<a href="http://mi-ftc.github.io/tutorial/o/opmode/index.html">same tab</a>) to make it useful.</p>

      <p>To build your code onto the robot, we will use the section of the toolbar outlined in <b class="specific">red</b> above. Connect a Control Hub with a USB-C cable to a <i>Windows</i> computer with the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client/getting-started/installation-instructions">REV Hardware Client</a> installed, wait for the device to show up in the middle dropdown box (open the dropdown and select it if necessary, and sometimes it won't show up until you open the dropdown), then click the <b class="specific">green</b> Run button to the right of this dropdown to build the code onto the Control Hub. When a small <b class="specific">green</b> "Launch Succeeded" notification appears in the bottom-left of the Studio window, then it is safe to unplug the Control Hub.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>The default <span class="specific">Android</span> (<b>Project</b> for stock IDEA) view in the Project pane is a convenient display of your project files, but it is not the actual file tree. Occasionally you will need to see the actual files for one reason or another. To do this, click the dropdown in the far upper-left of the Project pane that currently says <span class="specific">Android</span>, and change it to <span class="specific">Project Files</span> instead.</p>
