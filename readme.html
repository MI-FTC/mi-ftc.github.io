		<p>I only realized days after setting everything up that the name <i>MI-FTC</i> could be a bit confusing. This site is not actually associated with the state of Michigan, this name is just an unhappy accident. My imaginary company is abbreviated as MI-LLC, and since I've gotten used to setting things up under that name, I named this site MI-FTC. Hopefully this disclaimer dispels any potential confusion.  <i class="small">--Medium</i></p>
		<br><br>
		<p>Here lies a small assortment of FTC programming resources, most 
			notably the <a target="_blank" href="springboard/index.html">Springboard</a> 
			(<a href="springboard/index.html">same tab</a>).</p>
		<p>This README is a (suboptimal) example of how we format and lay out 
			these pages.</p>
		<p>We link to other sources as much as possible, but sometimes the right
			material either does not exist or is not easy to understand. In 
			those situations, we create our own!</p>
		<p>If you want to improve something, please do! As far as I can tell,
			you should be able to check out the repo and make a pull request. I 
			haven't nailed down all the details of how this organization works 
			yet.</p>
		<p>If you find something wrong, please make a scene in the Issues 
			section.</p>
		<p>And by the way, nothing is actually written in Java... but GitHub has
			picked up on the OpMode templates.</p>
		<br>
		<p>A random note for developers: If you clone the repo, change the 
			stylesheet, then load the page only to find that the style has not 
			updated, one or both of two things has gone wrong:<ul>
				<li>The browser cached the style, and you need to clear the page 
					cache (Shift+Refresh, Shift+Ctrl+R on Firefox).</li>
				<li>The page you're loading uses an absolute link to the file 
					(https://mi-ftc.github.io/...).</li>
			</ul></p>
