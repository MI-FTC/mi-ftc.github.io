		<b>This website is not currently under active development, and some information is likely out of date. Someday the future of this website will be decided and this notice will be updated (probably).</b>
	
		<p>Here lies a small assortment of FTC programming resources, most notably the <a target="_blank" href="springboard/index.html">Springboard</a> (<a href="springboard/index.html">same tab</a>).</p>
		<p>The <a href="internal/template/temp-page.html">Template Page</a> demonstrates how we format and lay out these pages.</p>
		<p>We link to other sources as much as possible, but sometimes the rightmaterial either does not exist or is not as easy to understand as we want it to be. In those situations, we create our own!</p>
		<p>If you want to improve something, please do! As far as I can tell, you should be able to check out the repo and make a pull request. I haven't quite figured out how these GitHub organizations work yet, so if it's broken, I'm sorry.</p>
		<p>If you find something wrong, please construct some criticism in the Issues section.</p>
    <p>We have just added rudimentary support for <a href="thememan.html">theming</a>. <em>It's not done yet</em>, but we're working on it! If you don't set a theme or just set the default theme, things should mostly work as normal.</p>
		<p>No part of the site itself is written in Java, but GitHub has picked up on the OpMode templates.</p>
		<br>
		<p>A random note for developers: If you clone the repo, change the stylesheet, then load the page only to find that the style has not updated, one or both of two things has gone wrong:<ul>
				<li>The browser cached the style, and you need to clear the page cache (Shift+Refresh, Shift+Ctrl+R on Firefox).</li>
				<li>The page you're loading uses an absolute link to the file (https://mi-ftc.github.io/...), so is receiving the deployed version of the file rather than the local version.</li>
			</ul></p>
