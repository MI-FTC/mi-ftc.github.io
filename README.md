Here lies a small assortment of FTC programming resources, most notably the [Springboard](springboard/index.html)
The [HTML README](readme.html) is a (suboptimal) example of how we format and lay out these pages.
We link to other sources as much as possible, but sometimes the right material either does not exist or is not easy to understand. In those situations, we create our own!
If you want to improve something, please do! As far as I can tell, you should be able to check out the repo and make a pull request. I haven't nailed down all the details of how this organization works yet.
If you find something wrong, please make a scene in the Issues section.
