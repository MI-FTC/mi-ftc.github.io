  I only realized days after setting everything up that the name *MI-FTC* could be a bit confusing. This site is not actually associated with the state of Michigan, this name is just an unhappy accident. My imaginary company is abbreviated as MI-LLC, and since I've gotten used to setting things up under that name, I named this site MI-FTC. Hopefully this disclaimer dispels any potential confusion.  *--Medium*  
  
  
Here lies a small assortment of FTC programming resources, most notably the [Springboard](springboard/index.html)  
The [HTML README](README.html) is a (suboptimal) example of how we format and lay out these pages.  
We link to other sources as much as possible, but sometimes the right material either does not exist or is not easy to understand. In those situations, we create our own!  
If you want to improve something, please do! As far as I can tell, you should be able to check out the repo and make a pull request. I haven't nailed down all the details of how this organization works yet.  
If you find something wrong, please throw a temper tantrum in the Issues section.  
And by the way, nothing is actually written in Java... but GitHub has picked up on the OpMode templates.  
  
A random note for developers: If you clone the repo, change the stylesheet, then load the page only to find that the style has not updated, one or both of two things has gone wrong:
- The browser cached the style, and you need to clear the page cache (Shift+Refresh, Shift+Ctrl+R on Firefox).
- The page you're loading uses an absolute link to the file (https://mi-ftc.github.io/...) and the old version is still deployed on GitHub Pages.
